> Parsing mailing lists to detect communication patterns.

Welcome to the Mailing List Community Analysis Tool(MLCAT). The main objective of this project is to develop a mailing list parser to extract information from mailing list such as senders, receivers, time stamps etc. This information is then used to construct an organizational (or communication) structure using hypergraphs and analyze it.
